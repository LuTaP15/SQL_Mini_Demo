# SQL_Mini_Demo

This demonstration illustrates various SQL concepts using a movie dataset üìΩÔ∏è. It starts by creating a database (movies.db) from a CSV file containing information about movies. Then, it loads a SQLite database and demonstrates different SQL techniques and queries, such as using the PRAGMA table_info() command to inspect the schema of the movie table, using the SELECT command with GROUP BY, AVG(), ORDER BY, LIMIT and WHERE clauses to retrieve specific information and statistics about the movies, and so on.
